Slug: About me


French data enthusiast based in Paris. I'm currently working at Viseo as a data scientist consultant, 	working for the [autonomous vehicle from Renault](https://group.renault.com/en/innovation-2/autonomous-vehicle). Curious and self-taught, I like to learn new things by reading books or articles.

During my previous roles I have demonstrated many achievements, and developed a wide range of skills Next to that I love wine, it's just a pleasant moment to share a bottle and try to find out all the secret of wine.
